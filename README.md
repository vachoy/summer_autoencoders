# summer_autoencoders
A collection of the various networks I created during my internship at Yale in summer 2018. Includes:

- logistic regressor
- simple linear regressor
- multidimensional linear regressor
- autoencoder
- variational autoencoder
- conditional variational autoencoder

Please see code comments for information more specific to each network.
